# TAECHO TECH TRIO: TURSO + NUXT

## Objective
Turso (https://turso.tech/) is a technology company built on top of **libSQL**, an open-source, distributed database engine. This foundation allows Turso to efficiently handle data across edge locations, ensuring low-latency and high-performance for real-time applications. By positioning databases closer to users, Turso aims to reduce latency and enhance performance for applications that require real-time data processing, such as those in IoT, gaming, and content delivery networks.

This Turso + Nuxt tutorial walks through the process of installing, configuring and building out several example queries using Turso within the Nuxt (vue.js) framework.
